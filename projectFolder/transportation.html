       <h1>Sustainable Transportation</h1>

       <!-- about -->
       <p>Despite being one of the biggest polluters (28 percent of U.S. GHG emissions), transportation is also essential to the function of our society. Although it is inescapable, how can we make it more sustainable?</p>

       <h2>Private Transportation</h2>
       <h3>Carpool</h3>
       <p>Sharing a vehicle with others reduces the number of cars on the road, which can significantly reduce emissions.</p>
       <h3>Low Pollution Vehicles</h3>
       <p>Choose a vehicle with an efficient engine that emits low levels of pollution. Most ideally, this could take the form of an electric vehicle.</p>
       <h3>Electric Vehicles</h3>
       <p>EVs have zero tailpipe emissions: they produce no carbon dioxide emissions when driving because they don't have an internal combustion engine (ICE) with exhaust fumes.</p>
       <h3>Walk or Bike</h3>
       <p>Walking and biking are the least carbon-intensive ways to get around. If your destination is within walking or biking distance, try to walk or bike instead of driving.</p>


       <!-- public transit-->
       <h2>Public Transportation</h2>
       <p>Public transit can include buses, trains, subways, light rail, or trams. Using public transit can reduce the need for personal vehicles and save energy.</p>
       <p>Public transportation carries a significantly higher number of passengers per vehicle, meaning that the same amount of fuel is used to transport many people at once, resulting in a much lower fuel consumption per passenger mile compared to a single-occupancy car.</p>

       <h2>Ideas on the Local Level</h2>
       <p>If you live in a small town or rural area, consider carpooling if your journey is far or biking/walking if your journey is short.</p>
       <p>If you live in a large city, consider biking/walking if your distance is short, or consider utilizing public transportation - remember, the more people that use public transportation systems, the more efficient and better it can get.</p>
